<h1>About Jim</h1>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-xs-12">
		<p>My name is Jim Althoff, also known as Jimmy, Dad and Pop. I've been a videographer since the very first days of consumer cameras, black and white with no electronic view finder. I've been taking thousand of hours of family and professional video over the years, and am now making an effort to make a lot of the stuff available to folks who've never seen it.<br><br>
